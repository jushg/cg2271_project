## Description

### Challenge Run 1: Remote-Control Mode

* Control the robot and navigate it through a simple maze.
* Using ESP32 for Wifi connectivity to a static IP address.
* Send command using a mobile app.

### Challenge Run 2: Self-Driving Mode

* Run until you detect an obstacle, go in circle around it, then go back. Stop when you detect the second obstacle.
* Using ultrasonic sensor to detect the obstacle.
* Turns are hardcoded due to time constraint.

### Notes: 
 * Casualties during the development process: 
    * 1 KL25Z Board: Fried due to overheating.
    * 2 ESP32: Fried because of inappropriate voltage supplied.
    * 1 Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04: Broken cause the robot hit the wall.
